## Question 8: Electricity vs Electronics

Electricity is the flow of electric charge through a conductor, typically involving currents and voltages for power generation, transmission, and utilization. It focuses on the movement of energy to perform work like lighting, heating, and mechanical motion
Electronics is the science of controlling electron flow using active components to process information, amplify signals, and perform logical operations. 

## Question 9: Electronic Device Example: Using Smartphone as example
Smartphone converts voice, text, and video into electrical signals, processes them using logic operations, and transmits/receives radio waves—all impossible with simple electrical circuits.
Key electronic components and their roles:
Microprocessor: The "brain" containing billions of transistors performing arithmetic/logic operations, running the operating system and apps.
Memory Chips (RAM/Flash): Store temporary data and permanent information using arrays of transistors.
RF Transceivers: Convert digital signals to radio waves for communication, using oscillators, mixers, and amplifiers.
Camera Sensor: Converts light photons into electrical signals via photodiodes, then digitizes them.
Touchscreen Controller: Detects capacitance changes when fingers approach, converting physical touch into digital coordinates.
Power Management IC: Regulates battery voltage precisely for different subsystems using switching regulators.
